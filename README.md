# sample-game-project
Contained in this repo is a sample third-person combat game I made using unreal engine 5 via guided tutorials on youtube (links to tutorials can be found at the end of this README). The sample game is still very unpolished but I will be using it to practice new things that I learn on unreal engine and game development in the future.

Current Features:
- Player character
- Player controls (walk, attack, dodge/roll, pick-up item)
- Simple player UI
- Simple inventory system (pick-up and drop items from inventory)
- Item stacking
- Interactable items
- Simple combat system
- Simple enemy AI (detect, follow, and attack player)
